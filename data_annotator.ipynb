    "# Clinical Trials LLM Annotation Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is **Step 2** in our educational pipeline demonstrating how AI can be both informative and useful. We'll use an LLM to intelligently annotate the clinical trials data we cleaned in `data_retriever.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an \"Agentic Workflow\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have heard terms like \"AI agents\" or \"agentic systems\" - often associated with autonomous AI that can take actions independently. **This notebook demonstrates a different, more controlled approach**: a much simpler, **circumscribed**, but still agentic workflow**.  We're using this workflow to automate a straightforward task: annotation and classification of our clinical trial data set that will allow us to understand it better with respect to a question we're interested in: what therapeutic categories have drugs targeting GLP-1 been investigated in?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intelligent Decision-Making**\n",
    "- The LLM interprets medical terminology, handles synonyms, and extracts meaning from unstructured text\n",
    "- Goes beyond simple string matching to understand context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strict Guardrails**\n",
    "- All LLM outputs are constrained to predefined formats (structured schemas)\n",
    "- Multiple validation layers designed to reduce hallucinations\n",
    "- Original data is never modified\n",
    "\n",
    "**Audit Trail**\n",
    "- Every LLM decision is logged\n",
    "- Results exported to CSV for human review\n",
    "- Fully transparent and traceable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Human Oversight**\n",
    "- Opportunity to review and modify the LLM assignments through human review and override capability"

    "### Approach 1: Fully Deterministic Script\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",

    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- ✅ Predictable and fast\n",
    "- ✅ No risk of hallucination\n",
    "- ✅ Easy to debug\n",

    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- ❌ Brittle without a more complex NLP workflow  - fails on unexpected inputs\n",
    "- ❌ Can't handle abbreviations or synonyms it wasn't programmed for\n",

    "- ✅ Understands context (e.g., \"diabetes in patients with...\" → extracts \"diabetes\")\n",
    "- ✅ Adapts to variations without reprogramming\n",
    "- ✅ Structured outputs prevent free-form hallucination\n",
    "- ✅ Validation layers catch errors\n",
    "- ✅ Audit trail for every decision\n",

    "\n",
    "### Protective Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Immutable Original**\n",
    "- The `cleaned_trials.pkl` file from `data_retriever.ipynb` is **never modified**\n",
    "- It remains as a permanent checkpoint you can always return to\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. `original_data` Attribute**\n",
    "- When `AnnotatorWorkflow` loads your data, it stores a copy in `self.original_data`\n",
    "- All operations happen on `self.working_data` \n",
    "- You can always compare original vs annotated to see what changed\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Non-Destructive Additions**\n",
    "- LLM doesn't overwrite existing columns\n",
    "- New information is **added** to:\n",
    "  - `matched_conditions` (appends MeSH terms)\n",
    "  - `tx_category` (new column)\n",
    "  - `tx_category_confidence` (new column)\n",
    "  - `llm_annotations` (tracks which fields were LLM-modified)\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Timestamped Outputs**\n",
    "- All exports include timestamps in filenames (e.g., `annotated_trials_20231113_143022.pkl`)\n",
    "- Never overwrites previous runs\n",
    "- Full versioning history maintained\n",

    "### Stage 1: Map Unmapped Conditions to Existing MeSH Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**  \n",
    "In `data_retriever.ipynb`, we used the `mesh_mapper` service to map conditions to MeSH terms via API lookup. However, some conditions failed to map because:\n",
    "- They use non-standard abbreviations (e.g., \"T2DM\", \"CAD\")\n",
    "- They're informal terms (e.g., \"high blood sugar\" instead of \"hyperglycemia\")\n",
    "- They include study parameters mixed with conditions (e.g., \"diabetes with A1C > 7%\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM Solution:**  \n",
    "The LLM reviews unmapped conditions and attempts to match them to **existing MeSH terms already in the dataset**.\n",

    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. Extract all conditions that lack MeSH mappings\n",
    "2. Get list of all successfully mapped MeSH terms from previous step\n",
    "3. Ask LLM: \"Which existing MeSH term best matches this unmapped condition?\"\n",
    "4. LLM returns: Matched term + confidence level \n",
    "5. **Validation:** Check that LLM's suggested term actually exists in our MeSH list\n",
    "6. Accept valid matches; reject and log invalid ones\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",

These need fresh MeSH lookups with an understanding of additional context from the trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM + API Solution:**  \n",
    "For remaining unmapped conditions, we use a **two-step process**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2a: Extract Primary Condition from Context**\n",
    "- Many trial descriptions are complex (eg, \"Type 2 Diabetes in patients with chronic kidney disease and obesity\") or innacurately coded in \"conditions\" (eg, \"incretins\") \n",
    "- LLM analyzes the full trial record (title, summary, outcomes, conditions list)\n",
    "- Extracts the **primary medical condition** being studied\n",
    "- Returns: Clean condition string suitable for MeSH database search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2b: Verify via NCBI API**\n",
    "- Take LLM-extracted condition and query NCBI's MeSH database\n",
    "- Use the same `mesh_mapper` service from the retriever notebook\n",
    "- Filter to disease/disorder categories only (tree codes C or F)\n",
    "- If found: Accept; If not found: Mark as \"NOT DETERMINED\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why two-step?**\n",
    "- LLM is great at understanding context and extracting meaning\n",
    "- But only the authoritative NCBI database can confirm valid MeSH terms\n",
    "- Combining both gives flexibility + accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Original condition: \"Diabetes in patients with renal impairment\"\n",

While it can be associated with metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the primary therapeutic focus is often on managing underlying metabolic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. However, since hematologists deal with blood disorders and conditions involving the liver's function in coagulation (e.g., hemochromatosis, Wilson disease), there may be some overlap. The most likely specialty here is endocrinology if the focus is on metabolic aspects, but given the possible connection to blood disorders and liver function (which falls under hematology), the classification is slightly uncertain. Alternative categories like gastroenterology or hepatology are considered, but they are not listed here. Thus, choosing hematolgy due to potential involvement in conditions like hemochromatosis that can cause fatty liver. However, if the condition is primarily metabolic, endocrinology might be more appropriate. Due to ambiguity, a moderate confidence.\n",

It is often associated with conditions like obesity and hypertension, which fall under cardiovascular issues. However, the term 'pseudotumor' literally means a tumor-like condition, and it is often linked to obstructive sleep apnea. Otolaryngology (ENT) could also be considered due to links to eustachian tube dysfunction. However, in the given categories, the closest match is neurology-related, but none of the listed categories directly map. Alternatively, since it's a condition affecting intracranial pressure, but there isn't a specific category like neurology in the list. Cardiovascular could be considered due to associated hypertension, but obesity is under endocrinology. Rheumatology might not fit. Given the options available, perhaps 'neurology' (not listed here), but since it's not an option, maybe 'vascular' which is under cardiovascular. However, the provided categories don't have a direct fit, so this classification may be uncertain. But among the given options, cardiovascular might be more appropriate if it's related to hypertension or obesity (endocrinology), but pseudotumor is classified under neurology in medical practice. However, since the list doesn't include neurology, the closest might be 'vascular' under cardiovascular or perhaps other. The user's instruction says to not classify if unsure, so this might be classified as 'other' but since the requirement is to make a classification if possible, and considering that in some contexts pseudotumor cerebri can have cardiovascular etiologies (like obesity), but the primary specialty treating it is neurology. Since the category 'neurology' isn't listed, but in the given options, perhaps this is a case where the best fit is cardiovascular if linked to hypertension or endocrinology if linked to obesity. But without a direct link, it's challenging. Given the options, perhaps 'other' is more accurate, but I need to check if any of the existing categories can be applied. Alternatively, since it's a pseudotumor cerebri, which is intracranial hypertension, but again, no direct category. So perhaps 'neurology' is the intended answer here, even though it's not listed in the options. However, since the user might have made a mistake here, but following the given categories: if 'vascular' is under cardiovascular, then maybe that's where it could be placed. But this requires some creativity as the condition isn't listed in standard categories. However, given the user's requirement to make a classification based on possible specialty, and given that pseudotumor cerebri is managed by neurologists in many cases, but since 'neurology' isn't an option, perhaps the most relevant among the given categories is cardiovascular if it's related to hypertension or endocrinology if related to obesity. But in reality, pseudotumor cerebri is a condition where the primary care might be neurology. However, since it's not an option here, perhaps 'other' is appropriate. But the user might expect a more precise answer.

Given the lack of specificity in the condition's origin, and since the example given for metabolic conditions is endocrinology (diabetes/obesity), but paresis can also result from kidney issues, the classification may depend on etiology. However, without additional context, nephrology is a plausible category as it deals with conditions affecting muscles and electrolytes due to kidney dysfunction, which could cause paresis. For instance, chronic kidney disease can lead to muscle weakness or paresis through electrolyte disturbances.

    "## How LLM Decisions Are Constrained: Structured Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow above has completed (or is running). Let's examine **how** the LLM is prevented from \"hallucinating\" or producing invalid outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem with Free-Form LLM Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "If we asked an LLM a simple question without constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# UNPREDICTABLE - No constraints\n",
    "response = llm.ask(\"What MeSH term matches 'T2DM'?\")\n",
    "# LLM might return:\n",
    "# \"The term T2DM refers to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, which is...\"\n",
    "# (free-form text, hard to parse, may include errors)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issues:**\n",
    "- Response format is unpredictable\n",
    "- No way to programmatically extract the MeSH ID\n",
    "- No confidence level\n",
    "- May include explanations mixed with data\n",
    "- Difficult to validate\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Pydantic Schemas (Structured Outputs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we define **strict data schemas** using Pydantic that the LLM **must** conform to.  Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Much Safer - Structured output\n",
    "class ConditionMapping(BaseModel):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Schema that LLM must follow\"\"\"\n",
    "    original_condition: str\n",
    "    matched_mesh_term: str\n",
    "    confidence: ConfidenceLevel \n",
    "    reasoning: str\n",
    "\n",
    "response = llm._with_structured_output(ConditionMapping).invoke(\n",
    "    \"What MeSH term matches 'T2DM'?\",\n",
    ") #Forces the expected output\n",
    "\n",
    "# Response is guaranteed to have these fields:\n",
