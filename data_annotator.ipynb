    "# Clinical Trials LLM Annotation Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is **Step 2** in our educational pipeline demonstrating how Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance bioinformatics workflows. We'll use an LLM to intelligently annotate the clinical trials data we cleaned in `data_retriever.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an \"Agentic Workflow\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have heard terms like \"AI agents\" or \"agentic systems\" - often associated with autonomous AI that can take actions independently. **This notebook demonstrates a different, more controlled approach**: a **circumscribed agentic workflow**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "**🧠 Intelligent Decision-Making**\n",
    "- The LLM interprets medical terminology, handles synonyms, and extracts meaning from unstructured text\n",
    "- Goes beyond simple string matching to understand context\n",
    "\n",
    "**🛡️ Strict Guardrails**\n",
    "- All LLM outputs are constrained to predefined formats (structured schemas)\n",
    "- Multiple validation layers prevent hallucinations\n",
    "- Original data is never modified\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔍 Audit Trail**\n",
    "- Every LLM decision is logged\n",
    "- Results exported to CSV for human review\n",
    "- Fully transparent and reproducible\n",
    "\n",
    "**👤 Human Oversight**\n",
    "- Optional human review and override capability\n",
    "- Red flags logged for manual inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Is NOT:\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Not** an autonomous agent that can take arbitrary actions  \n",
    "❌ **Not** a system that modifies or corrupts your raw data  \n",
    "❌ **Not** a black box - every decision is traceable  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What We'll Accomplish:\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook enriches our clinical trials dataset by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mapping unmapped conditions** → Finding MeSH terms for conditions that couldn't be automatically matched\n",
    "2. **Extracting primary conditions** → Identifying the main disease studied in each trial from context\n",
    "3. **Categorizing therapeutically** → Assigning trials to therapeutic areas (ONCOLOGY, CARDIOLOGY, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, each trial will have:\n",
    "- Standardized MeSH condition terms\n",
    "- Therapeutic category classification\n",
    "- Confidence scores for LLM decisions\n",
    "- Audit trail of all annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore how to integrate LLM intelligence **purposefully and safely** into a bioinformatics data pipeline."

    "### Approach 1: Fully Deterministic Script\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "```python\n",

    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- ✅ Predictable and fast\n",
    "- ✅ No risk of hallucination\n",
    "- ✅ Easy to debug\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- ❌ Brittle - fails on unexpected inputs\n",
    "- ❌ Can't handle abbreviations or synonyms it wasn't programmed for\n",
    "- ❌ Requires exhaustive enumeration of all possibilities\n",
    "- ❌ Can't understand context\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    reject_and_log(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- ✅ Handles synonyms, abbreviations, typos gracefully\n",
    "- ✅ Understands context (e.g., \"diabetes in patients with...\" → extracts \"diabetes\")\n",
    "- ✅ Adapts to variations without reprogramming\n",
    "- ✅ Structured outputs prevent free-form hallucination\n",
    "- ✅ Validation layers catch errors\n",
    "- ✅ Audit trail for every decision\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- ⚠️ Requires validation infrastructure\n",
    "- ⚠️ Slower than pure rule-based systems\n",
    "- ⚠️ Small risk of misinterpretation (mitigated by confidence scores)\n",

    "### Stage 1: Map Unmapped Conditions to Existing MeSH Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**  \n",
    "In `data_retriever.ipynb`, we used the `mesh_mapper` service to map conditions to MeSH terms via API lookup. However, some conditions failed to map because:\n",
    "- They use non-standard abbreviations (e.g., \"T2DM\", \"CAD\")\n",
    "- They're informal terms (e.g., \"high blood sugar\" instead of \"hyperglycemia\")\n",
    "- They include study parameters mixed with conditions (e.g., \"diabetes with A1C > 7%\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM Solution:**  \n",
    "The LLM reviews unmapped conditions and attempts to match them to **existing MeSH terms already in the dataset**.\n",

    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. Extract all conditions that lack MeSH mappings\n",
    "2. Get list of all successfully mapped MeSH terms from previous step\n",
    "3. Ask LLM: \"Which existing MeSH term best matches this unmapped condition?\"\n",
    "4. LLM returns: Matched term + confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)\n",
    "5. **Validation:** Check that LLM's suggested term actually exists in our MeSH list\n",
    "6. Accept valid matches; reject and log invalid ones\n",

    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",

    "Some unmapped conditions don't match any existing MeSH term in our dataset (e.g., trial studying a rare disease). These need fresh MeSH lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM + API Solution:**  \n",
    "For remaining unmapped conditions, we use a **two-step process**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2a: Extract Primary Condition from Context**\n",
    "- Many trial descriptions are complex: \"Type 2 Diabetes in patients with chronic kidney disease and obesity\"\n",
    "- LLM analyzes the full trial record (title, summary, outcomes, conditions list)\n",
    "- Extracts the **primary medical condition** being studied\n",
    "- Returns: Clean condition string suitable for MeSH database search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2b: Verify via NCBI API**\n",
    "- Take LLM-extracted condition and query NCBI's MeSH database\n",
    "- Use the same `mesh_mapper` service from the retriever notebook\n",
    "- Filter to disease/disorder categories only (tree codes C or F)\n",
    "- If found: Accept; If not found: Mark as \"NOT DETERMINED\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why two-step?**\n",
    "- LLM is great at understanding context and extracting meaning\n",
    "- But only the authoritative NCBI database can confirm valid MeSH terms\n",
    "- Combining both gives flexibility + accuracy\n",

    "Original condition: \"Diabetes in patients with renal impairment\"\n",

    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Structured Outputs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Predictable Format**\n",
    "- Every response has the same structure\n",
    "- Easy to parse programmatically\n",
    "- No need for regex or string manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Type Safety**\n",
    "- `confidence` must match exactly the requirements of the schema, for example \"VERY HIGH\", \"HIGH\", \"MEDIUM\",\"LOW\" or \"VERY_LOW\" (not \"pretty sure\" or \"maybe\")\n",
    "- `therapeutic_category` must be from predefined enum (not any random category)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Validation Built-In**\n",
    "- Pydantic automatically validates types\n",
    "- Missing required fields cause errors (caught immediately)\n",
    "- Invalid enum values rejected\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Self-Documentation**\n",
    "- Schema serves as clear specification for LLM\n",
    "- Reduces ambiguity in prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Enum Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "The therapeutic category must be one of exactly 22 options:\n",
    "\n",

    "class TherapeuticCategory(str, Enum):\n",
    "    ONCOLOGY = \"ONCOLOGY\"\n",
    "    ENDOCRINOLOGY = \"ENDOCRINOLOGY\"\n",
    "    CARDIOVASCULAR = \"CARDIOVASCULAR\"\n",
    "    # ... 19 more categories\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If LLM tries to return `\"METABOLISM\"` (not in enum) → **Validation error**, not accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "This prevents the LLM from inventing categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confidence Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice every schema includes a `confidence` field. This is crucial because:\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLMs can self-assess uncertainty:**\n",
    "For Example:\n",
    "- `HIGH`: Strong evidence, clear match\n",
    "- `MEDIUM`: Reasonable match but some ambiguity  \n",
    "- `LOW`: Weak match, manual review recommended\n",
    "\n",
    "While we haven't fully implemented this here, in could allow for more nuanced downstream filtering:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Only use high-confidence annotations\n",
    "high_conf = annotated_trials[annotated_trials['tx_category_confidence'] == 'HIGH']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Manual review prioritization:**\n",
    "- Focus human review on LOW confidence items\n",
    "- Trust HIGH confidence items (but still audit-able)\n",

    "\n",
    "Structured outputs + validation layers = **controlled intelligence**\n",

    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- LLM might extract a reasonable-sounding but non-existent term\n",

    "\n",
    "**Stage 3 (Categorization):** If LLM fails to return valid structured output, we retry up to 4 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why retry?**\n",
    "- Occasionally LLMs have transient failures (parsing errors, malformed JSON)\n",
    "- Retry gives LLM a second chance before marking as failed\n",
    "- After 4 attempts, we fail gracefully (mark as None) rather than crash\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Layer 5: Confidence-Based Filtering\n",
    "\n",

    "For example:\n",
    "- HIGH or better confidence: Use automatically\n",
    "- MEDIUM confidence: Spot-check a sample\n",
    "- LOW or worse confidence: Manual review required\n",

    "1. **LLM handles the bulk work** (synonym matching, context extraction, categorization)\n",
    "2. **Validation layers catch most errors** (schema checks, API verification, confidence scoring)\n",
    "3. **Humans review and correct edge cases** (domain expertise, nuanced judgment)\n",
    "4. **All decisions are auditable** (CSV exports, override logs, confidence scores)\n",
